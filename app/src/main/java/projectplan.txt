Adapter has to deal with data from both JSON query and DB query.
    Store JSON?
    Extract JSON to Movie object?

Save instance state:
    Poster activity - not strictly necessary as we could requery DB or JSON results, may need to store the current preference (or just fetch from SharedPreferences
    Preferences - store the popular / top rated / favorites selection in SharedPreferences
    Movie activity - probably need the base movie details stored and something about view state (e.g. viewing reviews, viewing overview, viewing trailer list.)

Plan -
    research picasso API - can I add a lambda for if the image fetch fails?
        builder.listener(new Picasso.Listener() { ... }).build().load(...).into(...);
