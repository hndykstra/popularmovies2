Activities:
    PosterActivity - Recycler view, etc.
    MovieDetailActivity - Detail view
ContentProviders:
    FavoriteMoviesProvider - SQLite db
Services:
    None
Async tasks:
    Fetch popular movies
    Fetch top-rated movies
    Fetch movie reviews
    Fetch movie trailers
    Fetch movie details

Adapter has to deal with data from both JSON query and DB query.
    Store JSON?
    Extract JSON to Movie object?

Save instance state:
    Poster activity - not strictly necessary as we could requery DB or JSON results
    Movie activity - probably need the base movie details stored and something about state (e.g. viewing reviews, viewing overview, viewing trailer list.)

Plan -
    research picasso API - can I add a lambda for if the image fetch fails?
    import existing layouts, update them.
    convert Movie instance to explicitly extract JSON to fields.
    write DB contract and helper methods, accepting / returing Movie object(s)
    make Movie parcelable
    write ContentProvider around the DB
    update detail view to use data binding.
    update the adapter to work with sets of Movies (cursor and JSON results)
    add Favorites option to menu and implement
    add accordion layouts to the detail view.

    fix some
